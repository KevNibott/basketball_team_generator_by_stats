# A Basketball Stats Tool

You will find a json style data in "constant.py".

This data is imported in "app.py" where you will find the team generator.

Once you run the "app.py" code:
  
  * The data will be cleaned
  
  * You will find a menu with readable instructions to follow
  
  * There is an additional tool to randomly generate a team (including the name, which is chosen by a list of names alocated in "constant.py")
  
  * If you want, you can choose a team name from a given list and the entire team will be generated keeping in mind the stats of each player so the team will be balanced
  
  * You can navigate through the other teams and see how the players are distributed (name of players will be sorted by height)
  
  * Once you have seen it all, you can go back to randomly generate another team, reset the teams already created or exit the program
